    <html>

            <p>You'll need this tag at the beginning of every HTML document you
                create. It ensures that a<br>
                browser knows that It's reading HTML,and that it expects HTML5,
                the latest version.<br>
                <br><br>
                Even though this isn't actually an HTML tag, it's still good one
                to know.
            </p><br>
            <h2><b>2.&lt;html&gt;</b></h2>
            <hr size="2" color="black" />

            <p>This is another tag that tells a browser that it's reading HTML.
                The &lt;html&gt; tag goes<br>
                straight after the DOCTYPE tag,and you close it with a
                &lt;/html&gt; tag right at the end of your<br>
                file.Everything else in your document goes between these tags.
            </p>

            <h2><b>3.&lt;head&gt;</b></h2>
            <p>
                The &lt;head&gt;tag starts the header section of your file. The
                stuff that goes in here doesn't<br>
                appear on your webpage.Instead,it contains metadata for search
                engines, and info for<br>
                your browser.
